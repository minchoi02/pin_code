### Usage

1. Use either Maven, MobileFirst CLI or your IDE of choice to [build and deploy the available `ResourceAdapter` and `PinCodeAttempts` adapters](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/creating-adapters/).

 The PinCodeAttempts Security Check adapter and the Resource adapter can be found in https://github.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/SecurityCheckAdapters/tree/release80.

2. From a command-line window, navigate to the project's root folder and run the command: `mfpdev app register`.

3. You can either set-up a [Web development environment](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/setting-up-your-development-environment/web-development-environment) that fits your needs, or use the provided Node.js-based reverse proxy.

#### WebSphere Liberty or Node.js
Follow the [Setting up the Web development environment](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/setting-up-your-development-environment/web-development-environment) tutorial.

#### Using the provided Node.js-based reverse proxy
- Make sure you have Node.js installed.
- Navigate to the sample's root folder and run the command: `npm install` followed by: `npm start`.

3. In the MobileFirst Console → PinCodeWeb → Security, map the `accessRestricted` scope to the `PinCodeAttempts` security check.
4. In a browser, load the URL [http://localhost:9081/sampleapp](http://localhost:9081/sampleapp).
5. Run the application in a browser. Press the **Get Balance** button and enter "1234" to display the balance.
